## Overview

**SCADA** (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) is a system used to monitor and control industrial processes and infrastructure. It combines software, hardware, and communication networks to collect and analyze real-time data from sensors, devices, and machines, enabling operators to make informed decisions and optimize operations.  

This project aims to emulate the fundamental behavior of a SCADA monitoring system. Our objective was to develop a lightweight solution for monitoring tags and alarms, creating an application that could be easily extended for larger projects that might incorporate hardware components. Due to limited hardware resources, we simulated the behavior of RTU (Remote Terminal Unit) drivers instead.

## Architecture

Explain the high-level architecture of the project. Include diagrams if possible to visually represent the components and their interactions. Describe the role of each component and how they work together to achieve the project's objectives.

## Prerequisites

List the prerequisites or dependencies required to set up and run the project infrastructure. Include both software and hardware requirements, as applicable. Be specific and provide versions if necessary.

## Installation

Provide detailed steps to install and configure the project infrastructure. This section should include all the necessary commands, configurations, and setups needed to get the project up and running. If there are different installation options or environments, mention them and provide instructions accordingly.

## Usage

Explain how to use the project infrastructure. Provide examples or use cases to demonstrate its functionality. Include any command-line instructions, API endpoints, or user interface information. If applicable, provide guidelines on how to access and interact with the infrastructure.

## Configuration

Describe the configuration options available for the project infrastructure. Include any configuration files or environment variables that need to be set. Explain the purpose and effect of each configuration option. If there are any sensitive or confidential configurations, mention how to handle them securely.
